The implementation in this directory is weird, inefficient, and bad.
It is not suitable for anything.

But the description of how the table-building "works", and the ideas behind it, is still good.
Just... never actually use this for anything, or you will discover (as I did!) that it's a bit more work to get something reasonable.
